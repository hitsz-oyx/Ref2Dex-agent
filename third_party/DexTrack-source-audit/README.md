<!-- 

DexTrack supports the following applications:
- Converting kinematic-only human-object manipulation trajectories into dynamics-aware robot hand action trajectories, enabling the robot to interact with the object while closely mimicking the corresponding kinematic states.

- Converting kinematic-only human-object manipulation trajectories to dynamics-aware dexterous robot hand action trajectories, driving the robot hand to interact with the object with the resulting states closely mimicking the corresponding kinematic references. 
- Developing a generalizable and versatile neural controller for dexterous manipulation. Unifiying manipulaton tasks into a general *tracking control* scheme and training to track abundant trajectories with diverse *tracking commands*, DexTrack can develop a tracking controller that can solve a wide range of manipulation tasks with nice generalization ability.  -->

### Kinematic Retargeting

Code uploaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18Zbl7mNaxV9CnLos_tM6CalyvB3sE1ce/view?usp=sharing). The retargeting pipeline used in both DexTrack and QuasiSim is based on keypoint-based retargeting. For a new robot hand, the user needs to manually define corresponding keypoints between the robot hand and the MANO hand. For Leap and Allegro, the selected keypoint indices are hardcoded in the implementation. The code is somewhat messy. The main entry script is `exp_runner_stage_1.py`.

<!-- We've also included code for kinematic retargeting in this repo. Please refer to []() for detailed usage.  -->


## Usage

<!-- Dexterous Manipulation Tracking - Usage -->


This repository includes RL environments, along with the training and evaluation procedures, for the dexterous manipulation tracking problem.
 <!-- using a simulated fly Allegro hand (6 global translational and rotational DoFs).  -->
We support 1) a fly Allegro hand (an Allegro hand with 6 global translational and rotational DoFs) and 2) a LEAP hand mounted on a Franka Panda arm.
Two control strategies (action spaces) are implemented:
- Cumulated residual positional targets with kinematic bias; 
- Relative positional targets. 
The original implementation uses the first action space. 

 <!-- with a simulated fly Allegro hand (an Allegro hand with 6 global translational and rotational DoFs). We support two types of control strategies (action spaces):
- Cumulated residual positional targets with kinematics bias; 
- Relative positional targets. 
The original DexTrack's implementation uses the first action space.  -->

DexTrack include two levels of tracking: 
- **Single trajectory tracking:** The goal is to train a trajectory-specific policy to follow a single manipulation trajectory.
- **Multiple trajectories tracking:** The goal is to train a generalizable tracking policy capable of mimicking multiple manipulation trajectories and generalizing to unseen sequences.
<!-- for a generalizable and versatile tracker. The goal is training a single tracking policy that is able to track multiple manipulation trajectories, and has the ability to generalize to unobserved sequences.  -->
<!-- In the following, we will illustrate the training and evaluation processes for these two settings. -->
Below, we will outline the training and evaluation processes for both settings.

Please ensure that you are running these commands in the `DexTrack/isaacgymenvs` folder. 

### Sincle trajectory tracking (fly Allegro hand)

**GRAB Dataset**



To train a single trajectory tracker for a sequence retargeted from the **GRAB** dataset using the `cumulative residual` action space, run the following code:
```bash
bash scripts/run_tracking_headless_grab_single.sh <GPU_ID> <SEQ_NAME>
```
Please replace `<GPU_ID>` with the index of the GPU you wish to use. Only single-GPU training is supported. For other arguments, replace `<SEQ_NAME>` with the name of the sequence you wish to track. Checkpoints will be saved in the `./logs` folder.

<!-- Please replace `<GPU_ID>` with the index of the card you wish to run the code on. We only support single gpu training. Similarly, `<SEQ_NAME>` should be replaced by the name of the sequence you wish to track. Checkpoints will be saved in the folder `./logs`.  -->

Once you have obtained a checkpoint with a satisfactory reward, run the following code to evaluate it. A display is required if `HEADLESS` is set to `False`.
<!-- After you've obtained a checkpoint with a satisfactory reward, run the following code to evaluate it. You need a display if setting `HEADLESS` to `False`.  -->
<!-- Please note that the evaluation code is not running in a headless mode (you need a display). -->
```bash
bash scripts/run_tracking_headless_grab_single_test.sh <GPU_ID> <SEQ_NAME> <CKPT> <HEADLESS>
```

<!-- To train a single trajectory tracker for a sequence retargeted from the **GRAB** dataset using the `relative positional` action space, run the following code: -->
To train a single-trajectory tracker for a sequence retargeted from the **GRAB** dataset using the `relative positional` action space, run the following code:
```bash
bash scripts/run_tracking_headless_grab_single_ctlv2.sh <GPU_ID> <SEQ_NAME>
```
Similarly, after you've obtained a good checkpoint, run the following code to evaluate it. 
```bash
bash scripts/run_tracking_headless_grab_single_test_ctlv2.sh <GPU_ID> <SEQ_NAME> <CKPT> <HEADLESS>
```


<!-- For sequences retargeted from TACO dataset, to track a trajectory with tag `<TAG>` using the `cumulative residual` action space, run the following code:
```bash
bash scripts/run_tracking_headless_taco_single.sh <GPU_ID> <TAG>
```
Similarly, after you've obtained a satisfactory checkpoint, run the following code to evaluate it. 
```bash
bash scripts/run_tracking_headless_taco_single_test.sh <GPU_ID> <TAG> <CKPT>
``` -->



Below, we provide several examples. 

The following videos illustrate their corresponding input (kinematic references retargeted from human-object manipulation trajectories) and output (tracking results) that can be achieved. 

<!-- These are their input (kinematic references retargeted from human-object manipulation trajectories) and output (tracking results) that we can achieve.  -->



|   |    Cube       |       Duck          |     Flute        |      
| :----------------------: | :----------------------: | :---------------------: | :---------------------: | 
| Kinematic References  |     ![](assets/static/cubesmall_inspect_kines.gif)        |       ![](assets/static/duck_inspect_kines.gif)         |      ![](assets/static/flute_pass_kines.gif)         |   
| Tracking Result | ![](assets/static/cubesmall_inspect_tracked.gif) | ![](assets/static/duck_inspect_tracked.gif) | ![](assets/static/flute_pass_tracked.gif) |

Please refer to the following instructions to reproduce the above tracking examples.


***Case 1: Cubesmall inspect***

To track the `cubesmall_inspect` trajectory from subject `s2` on `GPU 0`, whose corresponding sequence name is `ori_grab_s2_cubesmall_inspect_1`, please run:
```bash
bash scripts/run_tracking_headless_grab_single.sh 0 ori_grab_s2_cubesmall_inspect_1
```
This sequence can be tracked pretty well using quite short time. We can reach a reward more than `150` at epoch `50` using `22000` parallel environments. 

Our pre-trained weights can be downloaded form [](). Following instructions stated above and extract these files in the folder `./ckpts`, you can run the test code using our trained policy for this sequence using the following command:
```bash
bash scripts/run_tracking_headless_grab_single_test.sh 0 ori_grab_s2_cubesmall_inspect_1 ./ckpts/s2_cubesmall_inspect_ckpt.pth False 
```

***Case 2: Duck inspect***

To track the `duck_inspect` trajectory from subject `s2` on `GPU 0`, whose corresponding sequence name is `ori_grab_s2_duck_inspect_1`, please run:
```bash

```
This sequence can also be tracked pretty well after training for a short time. We can reach a reward more than `150` at epoch `100` using `22000` parallel environments. 

Similarly, our pretrained policy for this sequence can be evaluated using the following command:
```bash
bash scripts/run_tracking_headless_grab_single_test.sh 0 ori_grab_s2_duck_inspect_1 ./ckpts/s2_duck_inspect_ckpt.pth False
```

``` 
Our pretrained policy for this sequence can be evaluated using the following command:
```bash
bash scripts/run_tracking_headless_grab_single_test.sh 0 ori_grab_s2_flute_pass_1 ./ckpts/s2_flute_pass_ckpt.pth False
```




**TACO Dataset**

For sequences retargeted from **TACO** dataset, to track a trajectory with tag `<TAG>` using the `cumulative residual` action space, run the following code:
```bash
bash scripts/run_tracking_headless_taco_single.sh <GPU_ID> <TAG>
```
Similarly, after you've obtained a satisfactory checkpoint, run the following code to evaluate it. 
```bash
bash scripts/run_tracking_headless_taco_single_test.sh <GPU_ID> <TAG> <CKPT> <HEADLESS>
```



Below, we provide several examples. 

The following videos illustrate their corresponding input (kinematic references retargeted from human-object manipulation trajectories) and output (tracking results) that can be achieved.

| Tracking Result | ![](assets/static/taco_1_tracked.gif) | ![](assets/static/taco_2_tracked.gif) | ![](assets/static/taco_3_tracked.gif) |


***Case 1: Tool-using sequence (shovel) from TACO***

To track the tool using sequence from TACO dataset tagged with `taco_20231104_169` on `GPU 0`, run the following code
```bash
bash scripts/run_tracking_headless_taco_single.sh 0 taco_20231104_169
```
In our test, we can get nice result after 300 epochs training. To evaluate our pretrained policy, run the following comamnd:
```bash
bash scripts/run_tracking_headless_taco_single_test.sh 0 taco_20231104_169 ./ckpts/taco_1_ckpt.pth False 
```

```





### Multiple trajectory tracking (fly Allegro hand)

**GRAB Dataset**


To train a multiple trajectories tracker for sequences retargeted from the **GRAB** dataset using the `cumulative residual` action space, run the following code:
```bash
bash scripts/run_tracking_headless_grab_multiple.sh <GPU_ID> <SUBJ_NM> <SEQ_TAG_LIST>
```
Please replace `<GPU_ID>` with the index of the card you wish to run the code on. `<SEQ_TAG_LIST>` is the file specifying trajectories to track. 

For instance, to train a neural controller that can track all manipulation trajectories with the object `duck`, run the following command:
```bash
bash scripts/run_tracking_headless_grab_multiple.sh 0 '' ../assets/inst_tag_list_obj_duck.npy
```

For all trajectories in the GRAB's training split (trajectories from `s2` to `s10`), run:
```bash
bash scripts/run_tracking_headless_grab_multiple.sh 0 '' ''
```

<!-- Our pretrained checkpoint is `./ckpts/grab_duck_ckpt.pth`.  -->
<!-- The pretraiend policy for all trajectories in the GRAB's training split (trajectories from `s2` to `s10`) is `./ckpts/grab_trajs_tracking_ckpt.pth`.  -->
Run the following command to evaluate a checkpoint: 
```bash
bash scripts/run_tracking_headless_grab_multiple_test.sh <GPU_ID> <SEQ_NM> <CKPT> <HEADLESS> 
```

<!-- The pretraiend policy for all trajectories in the GRAB's training split (trajectories from `s2` to `s10`) is `./ckpts/grab_trajs_tracking_ckpt.pth`.  -->


Similarly, to train a multiple trajectory tracker for a sequence retargeted from **GRAB** dataset using the `relative target` action space, run the following code:
```bash
bash scripts/run_tracking_headless_grab_multiple_ctlv2.sh <GPU_ID> <SUBJ_NM> <SEQ_TAG_LIST>
```
Running the following command for evaluation:
```bash
bash scripts/run_tracking_headless_grab_multiple_test_ctlv2.sh <GPU_ID> <TAG> <CKPT> <HEADLESS> 
```

### Single trajectory tracking (LEAP hand with Franka arm)


To train a tracking policy for a sequence retargeted from the **GRAB** dataset using the `relative positional` action space, run the following code:
```bash
bash scripts/run_tracking_headless_grab_single_wfranka.sh <GPU_ID> <TAG>
```
For testing: 
```bash
 bash scripts/run_tracking_headless_grab_single_wfranka_test.sh <GPU_ID> <TAG> <CKPT> <HEADLESS>
```

In additional to trajectories contained in the original GRAB dataset, we've synthesized more trajectories with in-hand reorientations. Please refer to `data/modified_kinematics_data_leap_wfranka_v15urdf` for their kinematic motions (the in-hand reorienntation stage contains only object motion variations with hand pose fixed). To train a tracking policy for a synthesized trajectory, run the following code:
```bash
bash scripts/run_tracking_headless_grab_single_syntraj_wfranka.sh <GPU_ID> <TAG> <SAMPLE_ID>
```
`<SAMPLE_ID>` should be replaced by a integer ranging from `0` to `99`. 
For test:
```bash
bash scripts/run_tracking_headless_grab_single_syntraj_wfranka.sh <GPU_ID> <TAG> <SAMPLE_ID> <CKPT> <HEADLESS>
```

Below, we give several examples. 

Their corresponding input and output are illustrated in the following videos: 

|   |    Elephant       |       Hammer         |     Watch        |      
| :----------------------: | :----------------------: | :---------------------: | :---------------------: | 
| Kinematic References  |     ![](assets/static/elephant_inspect_kines.gif)        |       ![](assets/static/hammer_rt_kines.gif)         |      ![](assets/static/watch_set_kines.gif)         |   
| Tracking Result | ![](assets/static/elephant_inspect_tracked.gif) | ![](assets/static/hammer_rt_tracked.gif) | ![](assets/static/watch_set_tracked.gif) |


***Case 1: Elephant***

For training, run the following code
```bash
bash scripts/run_tracking_headless_grab_single_wfranka.sh 0 ori_grab_s2_elephant_inspect_1
```
To evaluate our pretrained policy, run the following comamnd:
```bash
bash scripts/run_tracking_headless_grab_single_wfranka_test.sh 0 ori_grab_s2_elephant_inspect_1 ./ckpts/elephant_inspect_wfranka_ckpt.pth False
```


***Case 2: Hammer***

For training, run the following code
```bash
bash scripts/run_tracking_headless_grab_single_syntraj_wfranka.sh 0 ori_grab_s2_hammer_use_2 6
```
To evaluate our pretrained policy, run the following comamnd:
```bash
bash scripts/run_tracking_headless_grab_single_syntraj_wfranka.sh 0 ori_grab_s2_hammer_use_2 6 ./ckpts/hammer_reorient_sample_6_ckpt.pth False
```



***Case 3: Watch***

For training, run the following code
```bash
bash scripts/run_tracking_headless_grab_single_wfranka.sh 0 s1_watch_set_2
```
To evaluate our pretrained policy, run the following comamnd:
```bash
bash scripts/run_tracking_headless_grab_single_wfranka_test.sh 0 ori_grab_s1_watch_set_2 ./ckpts/watch_set_ckpt.pth False 
```




### Multiple trajectories tracking (LEAP with Franka arm)

Similar to the fly hand setting, run the following command to train a tracking controller for sequences retargeted from the `GRAB` dataset:
```bash
bash scripts/run_tracking_headless_grab_multiple_wfranka.sh <GPU_ID> <SEQ_TAG_LIST>
```
For evaluation:
```bash
bash scripts/run_tracking_headless_grab_multiple_wfranka_test.sh <GPU_ID> <TAG> <CKPT> <HEADLESS>
```

<!-- We've included pre-trained checkpoints for `s4` and `s6` in the `./ckpts` folder (`leap_franka_grab_s${idx}_ckpt.pth`).  -->


**Notice**: In addition to the single and multiple trajectory tracking processes included above, DexTrack incorporates two key components that make the specialist-generalist iterative training framework work: 1) homotopy optimization for enhancing single trajectory tracking (applicable only to policies using the `cumulative residual` action space), and 2) a combination of IL and RL to improve the generalist tracker. However, these components require significant human effort and cannot easily be condensed into a single script. Besides, the corresponding code and scripts are too messy to be cleaned within an acceptable time frame. As a result, we do not currently plan to release them publicly.
