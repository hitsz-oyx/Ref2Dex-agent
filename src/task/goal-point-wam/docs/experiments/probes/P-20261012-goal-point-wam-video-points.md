# Shared backbone and direct video point supervision

Class: Blocker/engineering first. Serves the Task's goal-conditioned hand and
action-conditioned point-transition representation upstream of Mission C3.
User approves point trajectory supervision across datasets, shared actual
backbone parameters, optional SE(3) native head decoded to the common point
loss. Missing video object poses no longer block supervision.

Decision Note: retain the existing action-conditioned world interface for Cm;
add an independent direct point head and explicit video data contract. Native
and video batches use the SAME scene encoder, scene projection, hand/goal
decoder and action adapter. No copied video backbone. Native rigid head stays
optional; both decoders yield24-step metric point positions and common masked
Huber loss. Native R/t auxiliary losses are omitted in this new training entry.
This is explicit weight transfer from final10000, fresh optimizer/new checkpoint
kind, not a resume or a change to the active isolated remote job.

## Cheapest discriminating checks

1. Semantic tests: future labels do not enter observations; point permutation/
   query chunking preserve correspondence; missing/NaN labels contribute no
   gradients; duplicate point density does not inflate a window's loss.
2. Prepare one already acquired official TRAIN clip (no downloads), current
   frame15 and observed native frames12--15. Run pinned Omega on ONLY those
   four prefix frames, calibrate metric scale with confidence-qualified native
   hands. First-frame pixel grid chooses points using observed depth/voxel and
   workspace only. Existing full-clip CoTracker/depth provide FUTURE LABELS.
   Report independent prefix/teacher current-depth disagreement without
   concealing it via label rebasing. Labels have10Hz measurements interpolated
   to30Hz; native2x11 hand labels remain original30Hz.
3. Four-update one-GPU mixed native/video smoke, bounded900s, no checkpoint,
   main batch16/video batch4, max2048 video points, outputs <=20MB including
   prefix images. Check finite gradients and video loss reaching shared PTv3.
   GPU snapshot and ETA in progress log. Optional two-rank DDP wiring check
   uses the same four updates, not new seeds or method comparisons.

Inputs: original local official-TRAIN acquisition
`outputs/cm-pointflow-effect-pretrain/pointwam-train-inputs-20261011-r1/`;
existing qualified `episode00-basic_pick_place-0/clip01-f0015/teacher_frontend.npz`
under `pointwam-train-qualification-20261011-r1`; pinned local teacher assets.
New outputs: `outputs/goal-point-wam/video-points-admission-20261012-r1/` and
`outputs/goal-point-wam/video-points-engineering-20261012-r1/`.

No scientific fit until teacher drift/geometry inspection and separate-session
train/dev admission. Null goals are allowed for video point-world supervision
without inventing target-object IDs; optional current-frame target mask supplies
paired goal points and held-visible future goal masks. Full video object-goal
supervision needs that mask. The current-only video scene has no measured
surface normal/dynamics fields; they are explicitly zeroed, native hand history
is retained. This limitation must be considered during fit, not hidden as ground
truth static scene history.

Result: UNCLEAR; implementation/engineering verification in progress.
Decision: retain point-supervision implementation if wiring passes; admit a
scientific video corpus only after label quality checks.

Limitations/future evidence: per-frame depth drift, occlusion/scale stability,
moving/static point EPE, source-balanced held-session metrics and target-goal
admission; no causal method-quality, robot or RL claim from smoke.
